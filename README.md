Smart Cat Care Automation System**
**Project overview**
We propose to build a smart home automation system for cat care that combines IoT technology with pet care needs. The system will automatically feed cats at scheduled times, monitor their activity using camera surveillance, control access through an RFID-based pet door, and maintain optimal environmental conditions by monitoring temperature and humidity
